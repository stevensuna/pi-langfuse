## Why Langfuse?

Langfuse provides open-source observability for LLM applications. This extension traces Pi sessions locally or against any Langfuse-compatible endpoint so you can understand prompts, turns, tool calls, token usage, and failures.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Tracing**: Maps user prompts to per-turn spans and nested tool executions.
- **Streaming Generation**: Captures assistant responses as they stream.
- **LLM Metadata**: Records model, provider, token usage, and cost fields when pricing is configured.
- **Tool Observability**: Captures tool calls, sanitized arguments/results, and duration.
- **Session Correlation**: Groups prompts from the same Pi session into one Langfuse session.
- **Setup Wizard**: `/langfuse-init` configures either local self-hosted Langfuse or a remote/Langfuse Cloud endpoint.
- **Local-First Setup**: Local mode creates a self-hosted localhost Langfuse stack with generated secrets.
- **Autostart**: Once local init is complete, the extension starts Docker Compose on demand when tracing begins.
- **Raw Traces**: Optional lossless JSONL export for training, distillation, and audit workflows.

## Quick Start

Run the wizard inside Pi:

```text
/langfuse-init
```

Choose one of:

```text
Local self-hosted
Remote / Langfuse Cloud
```

Local mode creates a private Docker Compose stack. Remote mode writes only connection settings for Langfuse Cloud or an existing Langfuse instance.

## Local Quick Start

This is the recommended private setup. It does **not** require Langfuse Cloud.

### 1. Install the extension

```bash
pi install git:github.com/edxeth/pi-langfuse
```

For a local checkout, install dependencies and build first:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then enable the extension from your Pi settings/packages list.

### 2. Initialize local Langfuse

Inside Pi, run:

```text
/langfuse-init
```

The wizard asks for login details and confirmation before writing files. Defaults are:

```text
URL:      http://localhost:3100/auth/sign-in
Email:    local@example.test
Name:     Local User
Password: local-langfuse
```

Fast path for a local-only setup:

```text
/langfuse-init --yes
# equivalent:
/langfuse-init --yes --local
```

Useful options:

```text
/langfuse-init --yes --no-start
/langfuse-init --dir ~/.pi/agent/langfuse
/langfuse-init --host http://localhost:3100
/langfuse-init --email you@example.test --name "Your Name" --password local-langfuse
```

### 3. What gets created

By default, init writes into the active Pi agent directory:

```text
$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/langfuse
```

If `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is unset, standalone Pi falls back to:

```text
~/.pi/agent/langfuse
```

Files created:

```text
docker-compose.yml
.env
pi-langfuse.json
```

Safety rule: `/langfuse-init` refuses to initialize into a non-empty directory. It does not overwrite an existing Langfuse stack.

### 4. Autostart behavior

After init, `pi-langfuse.json` enables tracing and local autostart. From then on:

- `pi` starts tracing on sessionful prompts.
- If local Langfuse is not healthy, the extension runs `docker compose up -d` in the local Langfuse directory.
- If Langfuse is already healthy, it only performs a fast health check.
- Unpersisted/no-session runs are skipped by default.

Disable autostart for one process:

```bash
PI_LANGFUSE_AUTOSTART=0 pi
```

## Langfuse Cloud or Existing Langfuse

Cloud is optional. If you already have a Langfuse Cloud account or another Langfuse instance, choose `Remote / Langfuse Cloud` in the wizard.

Fast path:

```text
/langfuse-init --yes --remote \
  --host https://cloud.langfuse.com \
  --public-key pk-lf-... \
  --secret-key sk-lf-...
```

For a custom self-hosted remote instance, change `--host`:

```text
/langfuse-init --yes --remote \
  --host https://langfuse.example.com \
  --public-key pk-lf-... \
  --secret-key sk-lf-...
```

Remote mode creates only:

```text
$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/langfuse/pi-langfuse.json
```

It does not create Docker Compose files and does not enable local Docker autostart.

You can also configure keys manually instead of using `/langfuse-init`.

Configuration precedence:

1. `/extensions:settings` if the optional settings extension is installed
2. `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/langfuse/pi-langfuse.json`
3. `config.json` in this extension
4. `LANGFUSE_*` environment variables

Set:

```text
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
LANGFUSE_HOST
```

For self-hosted local mode, `LANGFUSE_HOST` is usually:

```text
http://localhost:3100
```

## Configuration

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enabled** | - | `true` | Global toggle for tracing. |
| **Public Key** | `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` | - | Langfuse project public key. |
| **Secret Key** | `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | - | Langfuse project secret key. |
| **Base URL** | `LANGFUSE_HOST` / `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` | `https://cloud.langfuse.com` | API host. Use `http://localhost:3100` for local. |
| **User ID** | `PI_LANGFUSE_USER_ID` | `$USER` | Associate traces with a specific user. |
| **Environment** | `PI_LANGFUSE_ENV` | - | Tag traces, e.g. `local`, `staging`, `production`. |
| **Release** | `PI_LANGFUSE_RELEASE` | - | Tag traces with a version or release ID. |
| **Local Autostart** | `PI_LANGFUSE_AUTOSTART` | `config dependent` | `0` disables Docker autostart, `1` forces it. |
| **Local Autostart Dir** | `PI_LANGFUSE_AUTOSTART_DIR` | `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/langfuse` | Directory containing `docker-compose.yml`. |
| **Capture Provider Payload** | `PI_LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_PROVIDER_PAYLOAD` | `false` | Optional provider payload capture inside Langfuse metadata. |
| **Raw Trace Export** | `PI_LANGFUSE_RAW_TRACE` | `false` | Lossless JSONL companion export for training/distillation data. |
| **Raw Trace Directory** | `PI_LANGFUSE_RAW_TRACE_DIR` | `~/.pi/agent/langfuse/raw-traces` | Root directory for raw trace companion files. |

## Usage

### Initialize Langfuse

```text
/langfuse-init
```

Non-interactive examples:

```text
/langfuse-init --yes --local
/langfuse-init --yes --remote --host https://cloud.langfuse.com --public-key pk-lf-... --secret-key sk-lf-...
```

### Toggle tracing

```text
/langfuse:toggle [on|off]
```

### Trace Model

```text
Trace (name: "pi-agent")
└── Span (name: "agent.prompt")
    └── Span (name: "agent.turn")
        ├── Generation (name: "llm-response")  <-- Cost/Token tracking
        └── Span (name: "tool:<name>")          <-- Arguments/Results
```

### Raw Traces

Langfuse is great for browsing runs, costs, tools, and failures. It is not meant to be a lossless training archive: UI fields can be truncated, and traces may be optimized for observability.

For fine-tuning, distillation, or audit workflows, enable raw traces:

```json
{
  "rawTraceEnabled": true,
  "rawTraceDir": "/home/devkit/.pi/agent/langfuse/raw-traces"
}
```

Raw traces are append-only JSONL companion files. They mirror Pi's native session layout, but live under `raw-traces`:

```text
Pi session:
  <agent-dir>/sessions/--project--/<session>.jsonl

Raw trace:
  ~/.pi/agent/langfuse/raw-traces/--project--/<session>.jsonl
```

If a nonstandard session path has no project directory to mirror, the raw trace is kept under the reserved fallback namespace instead of the raw-traces root:

```text
~/.pi/agent/langfuse/raw-traces/--unknown--/<session>.jsonl
```

Each file contains records such as:

- `session_start`
- `agent_prompt_start`
- `provider_request`
- `tool_call`
- `tool_result_first_seen`
- `tool_execution_end`
- `assistant_output`
- `session_compact`

The important guarantee is `tool_result_first_seen`: it captures the tool output as soon as this extension sees it, before later extensions can compress or rewrite it. Raw traces can continue writing even if Langfuse tracing is disabled or the Langfuse server is unavailable.

#### Session lifecycle

| Action | Raw trace behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| Normal session | Writes one companion JSONL file with the same project directory and filename. |
| `/move-session` with `pi-move-session` | Moves the raw trace companion when one exists; works normally when it does not. |
| Display rename | No change; the session filename does not change. |
| Fork or clone | Starts a new raw trace file for future events; parent evidence stays with the parent session. |
| Delete Pi session | Raw trace remains by default as training/audit evidence. |
| Manual filesystem move/rename | Move the matching raw trace file yourself if you want paths to stay mirrored. |

## Privacy Notes

Local init is designed for private localhost use:

- Langfuse web/API binds to `127.0.0.1:3100`.
- Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, and MinIO bind to localhost-only ports.
- Langfuse telemetry is disabled in the generated `.env` and Compose file.
- Langfuse Cloud is not used unless you explicitly configure a cloud host/key pair.

This does not change where your LLM provider sends prompts. If you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or another remote model provider, Pi still sends prompts to that provider.

Raw traces are intentionally lossless. Treat `raw-traces/` as sensitive data: it can contain prompts, provider payloads, tool arguments, tool outputs, file contents, logs, and secrets surfaced during a session.

## Troubleshooting

- **No traces?** Check `http://localhost:3100/api/public/health`, API keys, and Pi console warnings.
- **Docker did not start?** Run `docker compose up -d` inside the local Langfuse directory.
- **Wrong login?** Check the generated `.env` for `LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_EMAIL` and `LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_PASSWORD`.
- **Incomplete traces?** Ensure your Pi version supports `message_*`, tool, and session lifecycle events.
- **Cost is zero?** Token usage can be captured even when model pricing is not configured.
- **Large payloads in Langfuse UI?** Adjust the max-char limits in config/settings.
- **No raw trace file?** Check `rawTraceEnabled`, `rawTraceDir`, and that the run uses a persisted Pi session rather than `--no-session`.
